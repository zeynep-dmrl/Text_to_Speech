# Text_to_Speech
Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Different API’s are 
available in Python in order to convert text to speech. One of Such API’s is the 
Google Text to Speech commonly known as the gTTS API. It is very easy to use the 
library which converts the text entered, into an audio file which can be saved as 
a mp3 file. It supports several languages and the speech can be delivered in any 
one of the two available audio speeds, fast or slow. 

## Get Started
To install the required libraries, you can pip install command. Then import all 
libraries.

- tkinter
- gTTS
- pygame

I used the popular tkinter library for rendering graphics on a display window, 
gTTs (google text to speech) library to convert text to voice, and 
pygame library to play that converter voice from the text.

###### Importing the modules
###### Create the display window
###### Define functions
